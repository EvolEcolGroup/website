Do you want to join our group? You will have to be enthusiastic and imaginative, willing to challenge yourself, and
always ready to support your group mates. In the group, everyone has a project to lead on, but they are also welcome
to contribute to anyone else's project if they have the time and skills. Given
the interdisciplinarity of many our project, we commonly have long author lists that reflect the large number of
collaborators from across multiple fields that help us in our endeavors. In our group, you will have to be willing
to learn different ways of doing things, and appreciate the range of approaches that come from the varied backgrounds represented in our group.

As a student or postdoc in the group, you will have a dedicated weekly meeting with Andrea, so that you can
get prompt feedback on your work and ask for help if needed. We have a weekly group meeting where we give feedback
on presentations before conferences, and discuss common challenges and skills needed for research 


## Postgraduate (PhD and Master) Students

General information: Inquiries from prospective PhD & Master students are always welcome! However, you need to get in touch by late November if you want to be considered for university studentships, as the deadline for applications is in **early January**. There is an even earlier deadline if you come from the US to be considered for Gates scholarships. For details about the application process, see the Department of Zoology [Introduction to Postgraduate Courses](https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/study/postgraduate) page. 

If you are interested in working with me,
send me a CV and a cover letter telling me what kind of questions excite. Have you seen one of our projects advertised
(e.g. from the [NERC Doctorate Landscape Awards program](https://nercdtp.esc.cam.ac.uk/))? Tells us
why you want to do it. Have you read one of our recent papers? Tell us what follow up work you would be excited to do.

Our work is mostly computational, so you need to be comfortable with programming. We mostly use R, but also some python and C++; you do not need to be proficient in all of these languages, but some experience in at least one of
them is a necessity.

## Postdocs

Inquiries from potential postdocs are always welcome! We will, from time to time, advertise specific positions, but those are dependent on the grants that we have at any particular moment in time. Cambridge Colleges offer a 
number of Junior Research Fellowships which are designed as a first postdoc (i.e. straight out of a PhD). Each
college advertises its own fellowships, with the earliest calls starting in late August and ending in December. If
you are interested in applying for one of those, get in touch well in advance, so that we can discuss possible
topics and work on your application. Similarly, if you are interested in Marie Curie Fellowships, Newton International
Fellowships or other sources of funding, make sure you contact me well in advance; rushed applications invariably fail!

# Independent Senior Fellows
If you are senior postdoc and are interested in senior independent fellowships with our department, I am happy to
provide advice. The department runs a Senior Research Fellowships Sponsorship Scheme, with applications in the autumn.
