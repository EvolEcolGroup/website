    "text": "Individual responses to changing environments\n\nWhere should an albatross go to find food in a huge, mostly empty sea? And how will it cope with the fact that this year the squid it feeds on are not in the same place as last year?\nIn today’s rapidly changing environments, individuals are faced with multiple crucial decisions in their lifetime that need to account for such changes, from finding food to the timing of reproduction. Whilst they might have been adapted to varying conditions, the pace at which their environment is changing keeps increasing. What strategies had they evolved to cope with changing environments? Do all individuals in a population use the same general strategy, or do individuals specialise on different strategies? And, importantly, are these strategies still fit for purpose given the speed of anthropogenic climate change?\nMost of our work is on seabirds, in collaboration with Richard Phillips at the British Antarctic Survey, but we also work on other taxa, such as sharks, turtles and bears. We analyse huge tracking data, linking individual decisions to the environmental conditions they have experienced, and testing how well such moves “predict” the future. We also study how such decisions might put species in harms way by brining them into increased contact with humans (e.g. with fisheries or plastics."

    "text": "Metapopulation range dynamics and their consequences\n\nWhy are leopards in Africa almost panmictic, whilst their Asian counterparts show strong isolation by distance that has led to the designation of multiple subspecies? And why do giraffes show greater genetic population structure than zebras?\nThe large environmental changes that have occurred over the glacial cycles have led to dramatic changes in the distribution of species, fragmenting and reconnecting their ranges. This metapopulation dynamics, characterised by pulses of gene flow and isolation, plays a key role in shaping contemporary species. However, our ability to reconstruct the processes that have driven this complex dynamic (and potentially our ability to predict how it might change in the future) is limited.\nWe tackle this complex question by combining multiple lines of evidence, including contemporary ecological surveys, the paleontological record, population genetic data, and paleoclimate reconstructions, to build sophisticated computational models which allow us to test explicitly the role of climate and biotic interactions in shaping the genetics of contemporary species, including our own."

What drove cultural innovations in hunter gatherers?\nClimatic changes are often invoked as drivers for many of the key events that have shaped our species. But quantitatively testing these hypotheses is challenging. Working together with archaeologists, anthropologists and linguists, we have investigated the role of climate in driving brain and body size change, in shaping the emergence of major genetic lineages, and on the evolution of cultural differentiation.\nTo ask questions about our pasts we often quantitatively combine multiple lines of evidence, curating large datasets that synthesize information over entire regions. By bringing together the signals that we can recover from archaeology and genetics (using both modern and ancient DNA), we are able to go beyond the limits of each individual discipline."

Having been humbled by encounters with various shark species, he became keen to learn as much as he could about their behaviour and ecology. James gained a first-class Honours degree in biological sciences from the University of Oxford and then volunteered as a shark researcher at the Bimini Biological Field Station. At Bimini he cut his teeth catching, tagging and tracking sharks, and working with them so closely consolidated his passion and further motivated him to fight for marine conservation.\nJames then moved to work as a research scientist for the Save Our Seas Foundation, before completing a PhD in marine biology at the University of Plymouth in collaboration with the D’Arros Research Centre. His primary research focus was a comprehensive tagging programme tracking almost 200 sharks of seven different species in Seychelles, aiming to determine the factors that drive their movement behaviour and use this knowledge to inform effective conservation strategies. James’ research has helped to contribute to the design of marine protected areas and has revealed previously unknown open ocean migrations of tiger and bull sharks, highlighting the challenge of managing shark populations that span ocean basins. He continues his research as part of the Evolutionary Ecology Group at the University of Cambridge.\nJames fully realises the importance of actively promoting awareness of marine conservation issues, so he is particularly excited to lead the Save Our Sea Foundation team to help ensure that we can live with healthy oceans for generations to come."

Asking questions is what we do for a living, and you need to be determinate to find answers, even when nothing seems to work. Second, our research is at the interface of different disciplines, so you need to be willing to challenge yourself regularly to learn new methods, and be imaginative and creative in how you approach problems. Third, you will be working in big, collaborative projects, so you need to be a team player, willing to work with and help others. If this sounds like you, then keep reading.\nI believe it is really important that the group works as a team, and that we celebrate each other successes. For this reason, every student and postdoc has a specific project they lead, and all projects are different enough such that one project succeeding will not take away from another project. At the same time, everyone is welcome to contribute to any ongoing project in the group; the simple rule is that you can help on any project, but you can not take over someone else’s project. The long author lists of many of our papers tell you that this approach generally works well!\nThe reason why I am in academia is because I love asking questions about animals. For this reason, I enjoy meeting with my students and postdocs regularly, so that we can discuss how their projects progress, and work together to solve any new challenge that arises. I have scheduled individual weekly meetings with every member of my group to make sure that everyone is supported and gets feedback, irrespective of whether I am teaching or writing a grant that week. We also have a weekly group meeting when we can practice talks before conferences, or discuss new results and methods, or sometimes reflect on the challenges of academic life (such as imposter syndrome or diversity issues). Finally, every Tuesday, we have a hackathon, where we code together to solve common problems. In this way, we build the tools that we need to make our life easier, and learn from each other along the way. You can see the results of those efforts on our Resources page.\nIf everything you have read so far sounds good, then our group might be the right place for you. But feel free to contact any group member to get their views on what it is like to actually work in our group (and please do not cc Andrea if you do so, they need to be able to give you an honest answer without me checking what they say!)."
