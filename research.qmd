Our group is interested in understanding how animals (including our own species) respond
to changing environments. Our work spans from the ecological (individual movement decisions, range changes)
to the evolutionary (hybridisation, adaptation and speciation) time scale. Whilst below we
focus on these two extremes, a number of our projects cross that artificial divide, involving
elements of both.


## Individual responses to changing environments

Where should an albatross go to find food in huge, mostly empty sea? And how will it cope with
the fact that this year the squid he feeds on are not in the same place as last year?

In today's rapidly changing environments, individuals are faced with multiple crucial decisions in their
lifetime that need to account for such changes, from finding food to the timing of reproduction.
Whilst they might have been adapted to heterogeneous conditions, the pace at which their
environment is changing keeps increasing. What strategies had they evolved to cope
with changing environments? Do all individuals in a population use the same general strategy,
or do individuals specialise on different strategies? And, importantly, are these
strategies still fit for purpose given the speed of anthropogenic climate change? 

Most of our work is on marine birds, in collaboration
with the British Antarctic Survey, but we also work on other taxa, such as
sharks, turtles and bears. We analyse huge tracking data, linking individual decisions
to the environmental conditions they have experienced, and testing how well such
moves "predict" the future. We also study how such decisions might put species in harms way
by brining them into increased contact with humans.

## Metapopulation range dynamics and their consequences

<img src="./img/project_2_banner.png" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain" />

Why are leopards in Africa almost panmictic, when their Asian counterparts show strong isolation by distance
that has led to the designation of multiple subspecies? And why do giraffes show greater genetic population
structure than zebras?

The large environmental changes that have occurred over the glacial cycles have
led to dramatic changes in the ranges of species, fragmenting and reconnecting their
ranges. This metapopulation dynamics, characterised by pulses of gene flow and isolation,
plays a key role in shaping contemporary species. However, our ability to reconstruct
the processes that have driven this complex dynamic (and potentially our ability to
predict how it might change in the future) is limited. 

We tackle this complex
question by combining multiple lines of evidence, including contemporary ecological surveys,
the paleontological record, population genetic data, and paleoclimate reconstructions, to build sophisticated
computational models which allow us to test explicitly the role of climate and
biotic interactions in shaping the genetics of contemporary species, including our own.

## Tools to interrogate big data through space and time

Our work is highly interdisciplinary, and often uses huge datasets from multiple sources.
This forces us to build efficient computational workflows that can handle data in very
different formats. For certain projects, we also curate large datasets that collate information from
multiple sources. We share our tools and data with the broader scientific community by
making them open source. Check out our software and datasets on our [resources page](./resources.html).
