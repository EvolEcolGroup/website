Our group is interested in understanding how **animals (including our own species) respond
to changing environments**. Our work spans from the ecological (individual movement decisions, range changes)
to the evolutionary (hybridisation, adaptation and speciation) time scale. Whilst below we
focus on these two extremes, a number of our projects cross that artificial divide, involving
elements of both.

## Individual responses to changing environments

<img src="./img/alumni_banner.jpg" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"/>

Where should an albatross go to find food in a huge, mostly empty sea? And how will it cope with
the fact that this year the squid it feeds on are not in the same place as last year?

In today's rapidly changing environments, individuals are faced with multiple crucial decisions in their
lifetime that need to account for such changes, from finding food to the timing of reproduction.
Whilst they might have been adapted to varying conditions, the pace at which their
environment is changing keeps increasing. What strategies had they evolved to cope
with changing environments? Do all individuals in a population use the same general strategy,
or do individuals specialise on different strategies? And, importantly, are these
strategies still fit for purpose given the speed of anthropogenic climate change? 

Most of our work is on seabirds, in collaboration
with [Richard Phillips](https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/raphil/) at the British Antarctic Survey, 
but we also work on other taxa, such as
sharks, turtles and bears. We analyse huge tracking data, linking individual decisions
to the environmental conditions they have experienced, and testing how well such
moves "predict" the future. We also study how such decisions might put species in harms way
by brining them into increased contact with humans (e.g. with fisheries or plastics.

## Metapopulation range dynamics and their consequences

<img src="./img/leopard_banner.jpg" alt="leopard photo from https://animalia.bio/leopard under Share Alike licence" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain" />

Why are leopards in Africa almost panmictic, whilst their Asian counterparts show strong isolation by distance
that has led to the designation of multiple subspecies? And why do giraffes show greater genetic population
structure than zebras?

The large environmental changes that have occurred over the glacial cycles have
led to dramatic changes in the distribution of species, fragmenting and reconnecting their
ranges. This metapopulation dynamics, characterised by pulses of gene flow and isolation,
plays a key role in shaping contemporary species. However, our ability to reconstruct
the processes that have driven this complex dynamic (and potentially our ability to
predict how it might change in the future) is limited. 

We tackle this complex
question by combining multiple lines of evidence, including contemporary ecological surveys,
the paleontological record, population genetic data, and paleoclimate reconstructions, to build sophisticated
computational models which allow us to test explicitly the role of climate and
biotic interactions in shaping the genetics of contemporary species, including our own.

## Human evolutionary ecology ##

When did humans come out of Africa? Why were some moments more favourable than other? What drove cultural innovations in hunter gatherers?

Climatic changes are often invoked as drivers for many of the key events that have shaped our species. But
quantitatively testing these hypotheses is challenging. Working together with archaeologists, anthropologists and linguists,
we have investigated the role of climate in driving brain and body size change, in shaping the emergence of major genetic lineages, and on the evolution of cultural differentiation.

To ask questions about our pasts we often quantitatively combine multiple lines of evidence, curating large
datasets that synthesize information over entire regions. By bringing together the signals that we
can recover from archaeology and genetics (using both modern and ancient DNA), we are able to go beyond the limits of each individual discipline.

## Tools to interrogate big data through space and time

<img src="./img/resources_banner.jpg" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"/>

Our work is highly interdisciplinary, and often uses huge datasets from multiple sources.
This forces us to build efficient computational workflows that can handle data in very
different formats. For certain projects, we also curate large datasets that collate information from
multiple sources. We share our tools and data with the broader scientific community by
making them open source. Check out our software and datasets on our [resources page](./resources.html).
