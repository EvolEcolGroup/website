This quick document provides a few examples of how to clean up publication data. 
```{r}
csv_path <- "../people/andrea_manica_pubs.csv"
pubs <- read.csv(csv_path, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
nrow(pubs)
```

Find a paper with a given pattern in a title and remove it
```{r}
pattern <- "The influence of reproductive mode"
pubs <- pubs[!grepl(pattern, pubs$title, ignore.case = TRUE), ]
nrow(pubs)
```

Now save it to a new file
```{r}
write.csv(pubs, csv_path, row.names = FALSE)
```
