:::{#person-profile}
:::

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Evolutionary Ecology Group, Department of Zoology, and in the Pan-African Evolution Research Group (Max Planck Institute for Geoanthropology):

- Studying human local adaptation using bioinformatic models to reconstruct evolution of traits under selection (e.g. migraine, malaria spread/resistance), integrating past climate, environment, human demographies and genetics;

- Focusing on tools and methods to determine biogeographical ancestry, phenotypes and kinship estimates from DNA data for both genealogical and forensic applications.
