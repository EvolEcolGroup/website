:::{#person-profile}
:::

I am a PhD student working on using multiple lines of evidence like genomics and environment data to understand the ecological and evolutionary history of different species. I am interested in combining different computational analysis to dissect this complex process.  

Before Cambridge, I received my undergraduate from South China University of Technology and the University of Edinburgh, and my Master degree from the University of Copenhagen.
