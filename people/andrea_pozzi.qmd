:::{#person-profile}
:::


I am a PhD student at the Evolutionary Ecology Group at Cambridge. My research focuses on how climate has affected and will continue to affect dispersal patterns in the adder (*Vipera berus*). 

I was previously based at the University of Bangor where I investigated patterns of genetic health in UK adders for my MReS, and explored the presence of cryptic species in eastern African vipers for my BSc.
