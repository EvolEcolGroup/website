:::{#person-profile}
:::


I am a Research Fellow at Emmanuel College and at the Evolutionary Ecology Group. I am interested on the social and ecological **drivers of the diversity of ways in which humans live and have lived throughout our evolutionary history**. Moreover, how this diversity has shaped our genetic and cultural makeup. 

To investigate these questions, I combine methods and data from population genetics, climatic reconstructions, archaeology and ethnographic research among the BaYaka hunter-gatherers in the Republic of Congo.



**Keywords:** Population genetics, Behavioural ecology, Human evolutionary history, Cultural evolution
