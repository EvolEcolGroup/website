:::{#person-profile}
:::

I am a PhD student based at the University of Cambridge and the British Antarctic Survey. My project focusses on the role of habitat availability and preference in explaining the occurrence and abundance of albatross and petrel species in the Southern Ocean.

Previously I worked for a global conservation NGO, where my research focussed on analysing tracking data to understand which areas of the ocean seabirds frequent, and integrating this with other data such as threats to species to inform our seabird conservation work.

My main research interests are in using tracking data along with other available datasets to understand seabird distributions and foraging behaviour, and effectively communicating results to inform practical conservation work.
