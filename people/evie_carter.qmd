:::{#person-profile}
:::


I am a PhD student based at Anglia Ruskin University and the Evolutionary Ecology Group in Cambridge University Zoology department. My research focusses on the history of genetic admixture in the population of Madagascar, specifically considering how assortative mating has contributed to current patterns of phenotypic and genetic diversity. 

I worked in the commercial archaeology sector prior to my PhD, and have a background in archaeology and biological anthropology.
