- title: "Palaeoclimate reconstructions"
  description: "We have curated several time series of palaeoclimate reconstructions (e.g. Beyer et al. 2020 and Krapp et al. 2021). The easiest way to access these data is to use `pastclim`, but the raw data are also available from the repositories associated with those publications. See the `pastclim` website for details."
