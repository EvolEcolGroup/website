Work in my group can be split into three broad areas: the study of the costs and benefits of individual movement strategies, including their role in collective decision making; the reconstruction of movement using population genetics, including the role of natural selection in allowing colonists to adapt to new environments; and the spatial ecology of species interactions, including disease dynamics. My research often involves the use mathematical and statistical modelling to make inferences from large ecological and genetic datasets, but we also have a dedicated laboratory to study fish shoaling behaviour and a number of field projects scattered around the world."

My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

    "text": "Individual responses to changing environments\n\nWhere should an albatross go to find food in huge, mostly empty sea? And how will it cope with the fact that this year the squid he feeds on are not in the same place as last year?\nIn today’s rapidly changing environments, individuals are faced with multiple crucial decisions in their lifetime that need to account for such changes, from finding food to the timing of reproduction. Whilst they might have been adapted to heterogeneous conditions, the pace at which their environment is changing keeps increasing. What strategies had they evolved to cope with changing environments? Do all individuals in a population use the same general strategy, or do individuals specialise on different strategies? And, importantly, are these strategies still fit for purpose given the speed of anthropogenic climate change?\nMost of our work is on marine birds, in collaboration with the British Antarctic Survey, but we also work on other taxa, such as sharks, turtles and bears. We analyse huge tracking data, linking individual decisions to the environmental conditions they have experienced, and testing how well such moves “predict” the future. We also study how such decisions might put species in harms way by brining them into increased contact with humans."

    "text": "Metapopulation range dynamics and their consquences\n\nWhy are leopards in Africa almost panmictic, when their Asian counterparts show strong isolation by distance that has led to the designation of multiple subspecies? And why do giraffes show greater genetic population structure than zebras?\nThe large environmental changes that have occurred over the glacial cycles have led to dramatic changes in the ranges of species, fragmenting and reconnecting their ranges. This metapopulation dynamics, characterised by pulses of gene flow and isolation, plays a key role in shaping contemporary species. However, our ability to reconstruct the processes that have driven this complex dynamic (and potentially our ability to predict how it might change in the future) is limited.\nWe tackle this complex question by combining multiple lines of evidence, including contemporary ecological surveys, the paleontological record, population genetic data, and paleoclimate reconstructions, to build sophisticated computational models which allow us to test explicitly the role of climate and biotic interactions in shaping the genetics of contemporary species, including our own."
