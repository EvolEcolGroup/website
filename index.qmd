# Welcome to the Evolutionary Ecology Group

**We study how animals (including our own species) respond and adapt to changing environments**. Our work
spans from individual movement decisions (the ecological time scale) to longer term (evolutionary) 
consequences (species range and niche changes, hybridisation, adaptation). We answer these questions 
with sophisticated computational models that leverage big data from
multiple lines of evidence, including **tracking data**, **population genetics**, and **palaeoclimate reconstructions**.
